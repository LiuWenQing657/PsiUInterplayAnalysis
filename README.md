# PsiUInterplayAnalysis

This is the bioinformatics guide and scripts for PRAISE performed on small RNAs. 
For all the codes shown in this document, the parameters are the same as our data GSE299274. You can change suitable parameters for yourself.
The original bioinformatics pipeline of PRAISE is in https://github.com/Zhe-jiang/PRAISE.
